# Introduction


We are going to present  our fullstack application called "FixIt". This application makes the communication between clients and service providers alot more fluently and efficiently. Through our platform
users can create an account and search for specific services that they need. Our special feature is that our application is more like a social-media platform, in a sense that our customers
can add friends. Why we would add that feature? Well, we've thought about it this way. First, when we want to hire someone that we do not know personally we ask a friend, if he/she knows somebody
trustworthy. Now, with our application, you can see the reviews of the workers that have done projects for your friends, and see how your close ones reviewed them.
